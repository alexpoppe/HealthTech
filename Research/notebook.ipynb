According to\\nmedical studies, teens have an average hemoglobin A1c level\\nthat is one percent higher than that of adultsiii. As a result,\\nthey typically require more insulin. To complicate matters,\\nthe sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) that are the\\nhallmark of puberty work against insulin. While insulin lowers\\nblood glucose, sex hormones raise it.\\n---\\n A teen has school,\\nsports, other activities, a social life, and more. It could be that\\nyour teen is away from you more than he is home. So how is\\na parent supposed to recognize if any rebellion is going on?\\nOften, an elevated HbA1c level can be the first sign that makes\\nparents wonder if their teen is starting to rebel. But an elevated\\nHbA1c is not reason to immediately scream, “rebellion!”\\nsince hormones and growth can affect HbA1c levels.\\n---\\n Large swings\\nin HbA1c levels are one red flag. (By that we mean that\\nyour medical team feels the situation is cause for alarm and\\nimmediate action. Don’t forget teens are going to have a harder\\ntime with HbA1c levels even with you in charge.) If your\\nmedical team sees your teen struggling, you will want to find a\\nway to re-insert yourself into his daily care. Goodness knows,\\na parent cannot be around to count carbohydrates for a teen at\\nevery meal and every time he eats.\\n---\\n\\nAnd even if the numbers seem to be fine, if you see the\\ncombination of an elevated HbA1c and weight loss, contact\\nyour medical team about how to make sure your teen is safe\\nand not struggling with eating issues. If this turns out to be\\nthe case, it is a situation that demands immediate and expert\\nattention. Ask your medical team to help you find a local\\ncounselor to help your teen address this dangerous behavior.\\n---\\n You can let the teen read the\\nresults first and then read them on your own, or read them\\nwell before you are going to see your child.

Teens may also struggle with complying with their medical needs and may hide or avoid managing their diabetes, which can be a dangerous behavior. However, parents can try to reach their teens and use their privileges, such as driving, to encourage them to manage their diabetes properly.\"},\n",
