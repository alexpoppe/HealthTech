      "usually include the development of breast buds, an increase in\n",

      "rapid increase in height and weight. Another sign is body odor.\n",
      "The first time your child needs deodorant, you can pretty much\n",
      "know you’re into puberty now. As for menstruation, medical\n",
      "professionals regard the average age of commencement to\n",
      "occur between the ages of 12 and 13ii.\n",
      "For many teenage girls and their parents (and/or caregivers),\n",
      "managing T1D routines during a menstrual cycle is a whole\n",
      "new scenario. Some girls experience changes that affect their\n",
      "T1D management during menstruation. They may need more\n",
      "or less insulin than usual. A smart thing that parents and\n",
      "teens can do is to check blood-glucose levels regularly during\n",
      "menstrual periods and, over time, compare the numbers to\n",
      "look for patterns. The more information you gather, the better\n",
      "off your teenage daughter will be during this time. She may\n",
      "not like to do this, but just explain to her that by gathering\n",
      "information, you can help her learn how to simplify her T1D\n",
      "management during her menstrual period. It’s also important\n",
      "to keep a food log during menstruation. This will help inform\n",
      "your teen’s medical team and identify any changes in basal or\n",
      "long-acting insulin that may be needed during a menstrual\n",
      "period.\n",
      "For boys, the kickoff to puberty usually begins between the\n",
      "ages of 9 and 14, and the hormone that is a driving force at this\n",
      "time is testosterone. Growth in height and weight is a good\n",
      "first sign, as is a visible broadening of the shoulders. Increased\n",
      "testosterone production affects the larynx, which causes the\n",
      "voice to crack and then deepen. Boys will also develop more\n",
      "hair—on their chest, arms, legs, armpits, and genital areas.\n",
      "Both boys and girls often experience an increase in appetite as\n",
      "puberty begins. This means, of course, an increase in insulin\n",
      "requirements for meals. It’s important to know that both the\n",
      "growth of a teen’s body and the hormones responsible for this\n",
      "growth can affect insulin needs at the same time. In most cases,\n",
      "the result is an increase in insulin needs. For example, parents\n",
      "who once managed their child’s eating with a ratio of one unit\n",
      "of insulin for about 30 grams of carbohydrates are surprised\n",
      "when suddenly the same child needs one unit of insulin for 10–\n",
      "15 grams of carbohydrates. Clearly, the challenge for parents\n",
      "is to keep up with which increases are due to more food and\n",
      "which are due to changes in the growing teen’s body. And it is\n",
      "indeed just that—a challenge.\n",
      "So what exactly does puberty do to T1D overall? According to\n",
      "medical studies, teens have an average hemoglobin A1c level\n",
      "that is one percent higher than that of adultsiii. As a result,\n",
      "they typically require more insulin. To complicate matters,\n",
      "the sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) that are the\n",
      "hallmark of puberty work against insulin. While insulin lowers\n",
      "blood glucose, sex hormones raise it. Stress hormones, such\n",
      "as cortisol, also raise blood-glucose levels, and there can be a\n",
      "significant amount of stress experienced by a teen. In addition,\n",
      "during puberty, insulin action decreases by 30 to 50 percent,\n",
      "which also contributes to high blood-glucose levelsiv.\n",
      "Puberty is also a time when kids would much rather be with\n",
      "their friends than deal with T1D. This can make it difficult to\n",
      "figure out if it is the impact of puberty or the result of your\n",
      "child not doing what he needs to do to manage his blood sugar\n",
      "(or both) that is causing a high level. For the multitasking\n",
      "parent, this may be hard to accept, but teens also have a lot\n",
      "on their minds. Their preoccupations can lead to forgetting\n",
      "boluses/injections, blood-sugar checks, necessary supplies,\n",
      "and more. While trying to prepare children with T1D for\n",
      "independence, parents also have to make sure that they have\n",
      "everything that they need. In other words, your sometimes-\n",
      "surly child who thinks you know nothing actually needs you to\n",

      "safe. It really can seem like you are walking on a tightrope.\n",
      "One thing is for sure, children in puberty do need increased\n",
      "daily insulin. If you or your teen sees a sudden unexplained\n",
      "spike in numbers, it’s probably time to talk to your medical\n",
      "team about this and come up with a plan. This guide\n",
      "emphasizes that it is imperative to include your teen in every\n",
      "part of the process that impacts his T1D management. If you\n",
      "can engage him in decision-making early, he will have a\n",
      "better understanding of what is going on. This understanding\n",
      "may help soothe him when he is upset or despondent about\n",
      "blood-sugar levels that seem out of his control. Explain to\n",
      "him (and yourself) that taking more insulin during puberty is\n",
      "expected, important, and all-around acceptable. He may worry\n",
      "about gaining weight from the additional insulin that is needed\n",
      "for good control. Explain to him that taking the amount of\n",
      "insulin his body needs to keep his blood glucose in a safe and\n",
      "healthy range does not lead to weight gain. As long as he is\n",
      "making healthy food choices and being physically active, his\n",
      "weight should stay in a healthy range. Encourage your teen to\n",
      "discuss this concern with his diabetes professional, such as an\n",
      "endocrinologist or certified diabetes educator (CDE). During\n",
      "high school and especially college, teens can find themselves\n",
      "eating a lot of junk food, taking even more insulin, and gaining\n",
      "a lot of weight. This can be a vicious cycle that is hard to break,\n",

      "lived through a period of time when food was considered\n",
      "like medicine and certain foods and certain eating times were\n",

      "It’s important for a parent to watch closely but not overreact.\n",

      "In recent years, more and more research studies have found\n",

      "unique as each person with T1D. The goal is to find a way to\n",

      "that care.\n",
      "When?\n",
      "It would be nice if there were a cutoff age to guide people. For\n",
      "example to drive, you have to be 15 years old to have a permit\n",
      "and 16 years old to drive (although that varies from state to\n",

      "truth is this: kids need their parents or guardians who care\n",
      "for them to help manage their T1D, often even past their teen\n",
      "years. While it’s hard to be the parent of a child with T1D,\n",

      "the parent (if a child is in danger in any way, medical teams\n",
      "clearly speak to the parent no matter what the teen feels). This\n",
      "is a good first step. The teen can get a feel for advocating for\n",
      "himself in the doctor’s office and can have a place to discuss\n",
      "things without parents taking over or listening in.\n",
      "The medical team may suggest that the teen try keeping the\n",
      "logbook (or in these days, the meter memory, database, online\n",
      "recordkeeping tool, or phone app) and being in charge of\n",

      "parent included in these responsibilities. As much as a teen\n",
      "may want to keep it all private, a parent should know what is\n",

      "to deal with the information by speaking to the medical team.\n",
      "In many cases, teens just won’t be ready for this. And that’s\n",
      "okay. You can ask the medical team to come up with a system\n",

      "For the newly diagnosed teen with T1D, parents can feel very\n",

      "Perhaps they want their parents to give them their injections\n",
      "or calculate insulin doses for them. This is an indication that\n",

      "For boys, the kickoff to puberty usually begins between the\n",
