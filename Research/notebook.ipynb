So how is\\na parent supposed to recognize if any rebellion is going on?\\nOften, an elevated HbA1c level can be the first sign that makes\\nparents wonder if their teen is starting to rebel.

If this turns out to be\\nthe case, it is a situation that demands immediate and expert\\nattention. Ask your medical team to help you find a local\\ncounselor to help your teen address this dangerous behavior.\\n---\\n This can make it difficult to\\nfigure out if it is the impact of puberty or the result of your\\nchild not doing what he needs to do to manage his blood sugar\\n(or both) that is causing a high level. For the multitasking\\nparent, this may be hard to accept, but teens also have a lot\\non their minds. Their preoccupations can lead to forgetting\\nboluses/injections, blood-sugar checks, necessary supplies,\\nand more.\\n---\\n\\nParents should see this as a chance to reach their teens. Teens\\nare very in-the-moment. No articles about complications or\\nlectures about long-term results of poor control are going to\\nget through to most of them. But the privilege of driving a car?\\nNow that resonates.

The boy who whipped out his meter on the sidelines\\nat Little League now wants to check his blood sugar in the car\\nand not bring his meter with him to the playing field.

       "  'content': 'Context:\\n This understanding\\nmay help soothe him when he is upset or despondent about\\nblood-sugar levels that seem out of his control. Explain to\\nhim (and yourself) that taking more insulin during puberty is\\nexpected, important, and all-around acceptable. He may worry\\nabout gaining weight from the additional insulin that is needed\\nfor good control. Explain to him that taking the amount of\\ninsulin his body needs to keep his blood glucose in a safe and\\nhealthy range does not lead to weight gain.\\n---\\n For example, parents\\nwho once managed their child’s eating with a ratio of one unit\\nof insulin for about 30 grams of carbohydrates are surprised\\nwhen suddenly the same child needs one unit of insulin for 10–\\n15 grams of carbohydrates. Clearly, the challenge for parents\\nis to keep up with which increases are due to more food and\\nwhich are due to changes in the growing teen’s body. And it is\\nindeed just that—a challenge.\\n---\\n\\nSo what exactly does puberty do to T1D overall? According to\\nmedical studies, teens have an average hemoglobin A1c level\\nthat is one percent higher than that of adultsiii. As a result,\\nthey typically require more insulin. To complicate matters,\\nthe sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) that are the\\nhallmark of puberty work against insulin. While insulin lowers\\nblood glucose, sex hormones raise it.\\n---\\n This means that if someone with\\nT1D is drinking alcoholic beverages and her blood-sugar level\\ndrops, not only does being drunk hinder her ability to detect\\nand treat the low, but her body will not help her out. Most\\npeople think that because alcohol acts like a carbohydrate and\\nhas a tendency to raise the blood glucose—especially if the\\nbeverage has sugary or high-calorie mixers like juice, regular\\nsoda, or margarita mix—they may even take more insulin.\\n---\\n If your teen was diagnosed\\nback in the days of regular and NPH insulin, she probably\\nlived through a period of time when food was considered\\nlike medicine and certain foods and certain eating times were\\ncompletely off limits. All that weighs on a child’s mind—and it\\ncan lead to unhealthy eating behavior.\\nAdd to that the fact that a teen who wants to lose a few pounds\\nquickly can just cut back on insulin, and there is potential\\ntemptation.\\n---\\nQuestion:What does this say about the insuline intake?\\n---\\nAnswer:'},\n",
